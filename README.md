At [route1.io](http://route1.io/index.html) we've written high level, easy-to-use abstractions in Python for connecting to common APIs used in marketing analytics. This repository contains our official code, documentation, and tutorials to help you on your way accessing what matters most: *your data*.

```python3
from route1io_connectors import aws

# Credentials 
# NOTE: Storing credentials in source isn't secure in practice. 
#       It's recommended you store them in a more secure place.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
REGION_NAME = "YOUR_DEFAULT_REGION_NAME"

# Connect to S3 
s3 = aws.connect_to_S3(
    aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
    region_name=REGION_NAME
)

# Download remote file from S3 bucket to local machine
aws.download_from_S3(
    s3=s3,
    bucket="your.s3.bucket",
    key="local_file.csv"
    local_fpath="tmp/local_file.csv",
)
```
