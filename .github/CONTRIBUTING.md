# route1io-python-connectors
Thank you for your interest in contributing to route1.io's Python connectors!

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/route1io/route1io-python-connectors/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/route1io/route1io-python-connectors/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
