"""Google Credentials

Lightweight helper functions for easily going through all steps of the OAuth flow process
for accessing Google APIs. All functions return authenticated and authorized
credentials.

Google's example on credential access:
    https://developers.google.com/docs/api/quickstart/python
To create credentials:
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
To enable APIs:
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
Available OAuth 2.0 scope URL endpoints:
    https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes

Examples
--------
Generally the use case is for automating tasks that require accessing Google APIs
such as Sheets or Drive. Developers should first create an app on Google Cloud Platform,
enable relevant APIs, create OAuth 2.0 credentials, and then download those credentials
to their local machine.

Sample code for getting credentials for Google Drive API:

SCOPES = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
CLIENT_SECRETS_FPATH = "/path/to/client/secrets.json"
TOKEN_FPATH = "/path/to/save/token.json"
creds = get_token_from_full_auth_flow(TOKEN_FPATH, CLIENT_SECRETS_FPATH, SCOPES)
